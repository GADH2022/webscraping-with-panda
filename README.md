# webscraping-with-panda

AIM:

The aim of this project is to apply full web-scraping for the mission to Mars by collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating our insights.

output:

All the plots which we got by visualizing data are saved as png files.
The dataframe has been written in to csv files ,for the 1st part it is mars_output.csv.
The second part is mars_table.csv.

We did digging using pandas to find answers for the following questions:

How many months exist on Mars?
How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.
Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.
About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
